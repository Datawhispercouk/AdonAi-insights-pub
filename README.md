This repo contains code snippets to enable you to use our APIs! 


## Setup - chatbot_api_wrappers.py
1. (Optional step) Create a new python environment using pipenv or conda. To create using conda run the below command: 

```
conda create -n env_name python=3.11.0 
conda activate env_name
```
You may choose not to create a environment since we need to install only 1 library.  
2. Install requests using ``` pip install requests```  
3. Get API Key, MachineID and Password from your system admin!  
4. Replace values in the `chatbot_api_wrappers.py`.  
5. You can import the fuctions to use them. You can also reference the `main()` to understad the flow of the functions.
